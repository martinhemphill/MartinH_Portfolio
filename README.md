# MartinH_Portfolio
My Professional Portfolio

Building a professional portfolio where I can introduce myself. Displaying my name along with links to my most recent resume via PDF, LinkedIn and GitHub.

I've also listed a few projects I am particularly proud of. Especially my "What's in the Pantry" group project from class. Where I worked significantly within javascript with my partner to organize the data and make proper calls.
